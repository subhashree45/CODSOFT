            Information technology (IT) is a set of related fields that encompass computer systems, 
            software, programming languages, and data and information processing, and storage.
            IT forms part of information and communications technology (ICT).
            An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system, 
            a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, 
            software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users, 
            and an IT project usually refers to the commissioning and implementation of an IT system.
            Successful IT projects require meticulous planning, seamless integration, and ongoing maintenance to 
            ensure optimal functionality and alignment with organizational objectives.

        Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and manifests in various forms.
        Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public schools, 
        following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the 
        formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. 
        Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education,
        primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Additionally, the term "education" can 
        denote the mental states and qualities of educated individuals and the academic field studying 
        educational phenomena.
